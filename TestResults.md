### Mutual Fund Domain : General FAQs
* What is Open-ended Fund/Scheme ?
An open-ended fund or scheme is a type of mutual fund that does not have a fixed number of shares or units. Investors can buy and sell shares of the fund at any time, and the fund continuously issues new shares to accommodate new investments. This flexibility allows investors to enter or exit the fund based on their financial needs. The price of the shares is determined by the net asset value (NAV) of the fund, which is calculated at the end of each trading day. Open-ended funds are popular for their liquidity and ease of access.
